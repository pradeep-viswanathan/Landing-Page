## Responsive Landing Page

This project is a responsive landing page created as part of my internship, designed using **HTML** and **CSS** with `display: flex`. The page includes sections such as navigation, about, features, products, services, contact, and footer, and features interactive animations for an engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes using `display: flex` without relying on CSS Flexbox.
- **CSS Animations**: Smooth transitions and animations applied to buttons, social media icons, and overlays.
- **Custom Scrollbar**: Styled scrollbar to match the theme of the page.
- **Interactive Hover Effects**: Hover effects on buttons and social icons for a polished, interactive feel.

## Skills and Tools Learned

- **HTML**: Semantic structuring, class naming conventions, and element organization
- **CSS**: Media queries, variables (`:root{}`), animations, transitions, overlays, and hover effects
- **Responsive Design Techniques**: Used `display: flex` for layout adjustments across devices
- **Additional Styling**: Customized scrollbars and applied CSS animations to social media icons
